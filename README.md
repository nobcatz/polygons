Polygons (a game of memory)
===============

An android mobile game, made for a university subject.

It was published on the play store as it was *mandatory* to do so, but it has been removed by me ([TetAlius](github.com/TetAlius)) since then. 

I'm fond of the project, as this was my first android app released on the Play Store, I decided to keep the code.

You can try the game by cloning and compiling it. I hope you like it :)
